                <p>
                    I am an undergraduate student of pure mathematics and statistics at the University of Michigan. 
                    <br><br>
                    My area of study/research is primarily centered on probability theory and applied functional analysis. 
                    <br>
                    In particular, high dimensional probability (and its applications) are my focus. 
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.html">Here's my favourite text that covers the topic, written by Dr. Roman Vershynin</a>

                    You can also get to know me a bit more holistically from the little activities I enjoy.
                    <br><br>
                    Aside from mathematics, I absolutely love zoology, marine biology, and genetic analysis. I enjoy paleontology to a great extent as well (click here for my fossil collection NOT UP TO DATE/ ONLY DEVONIAN ERA FOSSILS).
